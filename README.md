### use " ./test modellist.txt data/test_seq.txt result.txt > re.out " to test
### use " ./test_acc re.out data/test_lbl.txt " to test accuracy
### use ./test.sh to get acc_{i}.out(i from 1 to 10) to get accuracy of iteration from 100 to 1000, the last line of acc_{i}.out is the accuracy
### there is a ./src/test_acc.c
### the re.out will not occur in homework submission, it is only for debugging.(means ./test will not write on stdout)
### the ./test_acc and ./test.sh will not occur in homework submission, it is only for debugging and testing.
